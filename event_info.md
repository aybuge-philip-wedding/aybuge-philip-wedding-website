A typical Turkish wedding includes two main days of celebrations:
1. Henna Night (KÄ±na Gecesi)
2. The Wedding Party (DÃ¼ÄŸÃ¼n)

The central theme of both events revolves around dancing ðŸ•ºðŸ’ƒ. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each event:

## Henna Night (KÄ±na Gecesi)

Henna Night is a more intimate and traditional pre-wedding event compared to the main wedding day. It usually involves close friends and family. During the event, the bride and groom have henna applied to their hands as a symbolic gesture of blessings and good luck for their marriage. The theme color for the bride-to-be is red, and she often wears a traditional outfit called a "bindallÄ±."

**Food and Drink:** While there will be appetizers and refreshments, there is typically no full course meal provided during Henna Night.

#### Dress Code:
- **For Women:** A cocktail dress is appropriate, but remember to save your more elaborate attire for the wedding day. This event is smaller and more laid-back.
- **For Men:** Smart casual attire is recommended. Opt for pants/jeans and a shirt.

## Wedding Party (DÃ¼ÄŸÃ¼n)

This is the main event and is characterized by a more festive atmosphere. The celebration begins with a dinner, followed by a night filled with dancing and music ðŸª©. The playlist will predominantly feature Turkish songs to immerse our guests in the culture, but there will also be some international tracks for everyone to enjoy a familiar dance.

**Food and Drink:** A full meal will be served at the wedding party.

#### Dress Code:
- **For Women:** A cocktail dress is suitable, but feel free to dress as elegantly as you wish! Avoid wearing white, as it is reserved for the bride. Searching "dÃ¼ÄŸÃ¼n davetlisi abiye elbise" online may give you some inspiration for your outfit.
- **For Men:** Smart casual or formal attire, such as a suit, is appropriate. A combination of pants and a shirt will also work well.
