    "content": "What COVID travel measures are in place in France?\n\nMeasures may vary from non-UK origins - check local guidance.\n\nFrom the UK, see current measures. You can enter France from the UK if you:\n\n\n  Complete a “sworn statement”.\n  Prove that you’ve been fully vaccinated, and your last dose was less than nine months ago. If you are 18+, and your last dose was more than nine months ago, you will NOT be considered fully vaccinated unless you have also received a booster.\n  Since 12 Feb you no longer need to present proof of a negative test before you travel if you’re fully vaccinated.\n\n\nWhat should I wear?\n\nThe only event with a dress code is on Saturday.\n\nOur theme is “Riviera Chic”. Think linen, open collars, sandals &amp; midi dresses.\n\nIt’s likely going to be hot, with an average daytime temp of 27°C, so don’t feel the need to wear a suit. If it’s a scorcher, shorts are encouraged (we want you to enjoy yourself, not suffer!).\n\nIf you want to take a dip in the pool make sure to bring your swimmers!\n\nCan I bring my kids?\n\nWe really do love kids, however the Saturday events will be adults and babes-in-arms only (if this applies to you please let us know on the RSVP). To organise a babysitter, call or text Marlene at +33 6 83 47 46 43. Feel free to bring your kids to events on Friday and Sunday.\n\nCan I bring a plus one?\n\nPlease check your invite!\n\nIs the wedding outdoors?\n\nAssuming the weather is good, the ceremony will be outdoors. Dinner will be served in the marquee. The grounds are pretty amazing, so expect to walk around outside.\n\nWho made the website?\n\nArchie, of course 😀\n\nI have another question\n\nJust ask us!\n",

    "content": "Explore Cappadocia\n\nIf you have some extra time during your visit to Niğde, we highly recommend exploring Cappadocia, one of Turkey’s most stunning regions. It is approximately a 1.5-hour drive from Niğde and Cappadocia is renowned for its unique landscapes, historical sites, and cultural significance.\n\nCappadocia is famous for its distinctive rock formations known as “fairy chimneys,” ancient cave dwellings, and historical underground cities. The region’s history spans centuries, offering a fascinating glimpse into ancient civilizations and stunning natural beauty.\n\nHighlights of Cappadocia:\n\n\n  Hot Air Balloon Rides: Great way of expericing the city from above but it could be 100-200 EUR per person. They also start 5 am in the morning!\n  Göreme Open-Air Museum: This place a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a must-see. It is a collection of cave churches adorned with ancient frescoes.\n  Hiking Trails: You can discover various hiking trails that take you through valleys adorned with fairy chimneys and lush scenery.\n  Underground Cities: Anotheroption is to visit intriguing ancient underground cities like Derinkuyu or Kaymaklı, carved out centuries ago for protection.\n\n\nPlan Your Visit\n\nCappadocia is quite a tourist-friendly place with plenty of options for accommodations and tours, so you can tailor your experience to what suits you best.\n",
