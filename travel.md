## Travel Options✈️

Unfortunately Niğde does not have an airport but there are 3 close airports to the city:

- [**Adana Cukurova Airport (COV)**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UX7SuAMSMLbZ58CF6)
- [**Kayseri Airport (ASR)**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KV581zoaD1VKzQjP7)
- [**Nevsehir Airport (NAV)**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M2SdRQ5vz4J5MpZK7)

To get to Niğde after arriving to the airport, you could take a bus from the cetral bus station of the respective city (after arriving there from ther airport via taxi), however, we recommend renting a car from the airport as this would be much easier for no-Turkish speakers. See the below section to to have a ridesharing with other people.

### Ridesharing 🚗 🤝🏼
As most people's final leg of transport will involve a car, we've set up a [ridesharing spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17TE7LQ90_VMJVCvfEubwoyOBMFSpKxGdpt4Ksubk-zc/edit?usp=sharing), where you can see who is going where and when. If you are looking for, or offering shared transport, add your details / contact people directly.
